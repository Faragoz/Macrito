As part of my studies in France I had the opportunity to do an internship for 6 months at Spartoo. 

My position was Account Manager International, which I could summarize as quality engineering with an ability to interact in different languages.

During my stay at Spartoo, some of the functions I was given were continuous improvement and absolute quality control. 

Once I understood and integrated the processes related to my position, I identified several improvements that could be made. Principally a task that would require up to a week of work to be done and that could be automated, which translates into an unnecessary expense for the company. 

After I identified the problem to be addressed, I made it my personal internship project during my last month, resulting in this solution developed using VBA with the objective of making it as friendly as possible to my coworkers, for its use and, if necessary, modification.

I hope this source code can be useful for someone in the future with a similar project.
